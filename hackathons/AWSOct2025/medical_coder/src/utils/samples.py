Plan:
Parkinson's disease: Start/continue carbidopa-levodopa as indicated, refer to neurology for medication titration, initiate physical and occupational therapy to improve mobility and fine motor skills.
Alzheimer's disease: Begin cognitive-enhancing therapy (e.g., donepezil), monitor progression, recommend neuropsychological evaluation and memory exercises.
Type 2 diabetes mellitus: Optimize glycemic control, check HbA1c, reinforce diet and exercise, consider referral to endocrinology for medication adjustment.
Continue Lisinopril and Atorvastatin as prescribed.
Encourage lifestyle modifications: regular exercise, cognitive stimulation, heart-healthy diet, weight management, and social engagement.
Schedule follow-up in 3 months or sooner if motor, cognitive, or glycemic symptoms worsen.
