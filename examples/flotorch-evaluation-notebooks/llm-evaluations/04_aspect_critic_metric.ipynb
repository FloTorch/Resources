    "This notebook provides a step-by-step guide to **evaluate a question-answering agent (RAG)** using the **Flotorch SDK** and **Flotorch Eval** library.  \n",
    "The use case here is an **E-commerce Customer Service Assistant** — an LLM-powered agent designed to answer questions about **products, specifications, pricing, return policies, and warranty information**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Use Case Overview**\n",
    "\n",
    "The **E-commerce Assistant** helps customers get accurate information about:\n",
    "- **Electronics** (Laptops, Smart Home Devices, Televisions)\n",
    "- **Home Appliances** (Washing Machines, Refrigerators, Vacuum Cleaners)\n",
    "- **Fashion & Apparel** (Clothing, Footwear, Accessories)\n",
    "- **Return & Refund Policies** (Return windows, eligibility, processes)\n",
    "- **Warranty Information** (Coverage, claims, extended warranties)\n",
    "- **Product Specifications** (Technical details, dimensions, compatibility)\n",
    "\n",
    "It retrieves relevant information from a **Comprehensive E-commerce Product Catalog and Policy Documentation** containing detailed product specifications, pricing, and policy information, then generates helpful, accurate responses to customer inquiries.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook focuses on evaluating **specific quality aspects** of the model's responses using the **Aspect Critic metric** — that is, whether the generated answers meet defined criteria for **accuracy, completeness, and professionalism**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Notebook Workflow**\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll follow a structured evaluation process:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Iterate Questions** – Loop through each customer question in the `e-commerce_gt.json` file (Ground Truth).  \n",
    "2. **Retrieve Context** – Fetch relevant product/policy information from the E-commerce Knowledge Base.  \n",
    "3. **Generate Answer** – Use the system prompt and LLM to produce a customer service response.  \n",
    "4. **Store Results** – Log each question, retrieved context, generated answer, and ground truth.  \n",
    "5. **Evaluate Custom Aspects** – Use `LLMEvaluator` from Flotorch Eval to assess specific quality aspects of each response.  \n",
    "6. **Display Results** – Summarize the aspect scores in a simple comparison table.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Metric Evaluated — Aspect Critic**\n",
    "\n",
    "We track a single guardrail-focused signal: **Aspect Critic**. It scores whether the assistant’s response satisfies the bespoke safety and clarity rubric we defined for the E-commerce Assistant. A score of 1 means the answer fully meets an aspect, while 0 flags a failure, helping us prioritize moderation or copy-editing fixes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Ragas Aspect Critic (Flotorch `evaluation_engine=\"ragas\"`)\n",
    "- Uses an evaluator LLM to judge each response against the custom aspects (`maliciousness`, `coherence`).  \n",
    "- Returns binary per-aspect scores, then aggregates them so we can monitor overall guardrail health.  \n",
    "- Surfaces responses that are unsafe (maliciousness = 0) or poorly structured (coherence = 0), giving us immediate cues for intervention.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Evaluation Engine**\n",
    "\n",
    "- `evaluation_engine=\"auto\"` — lets Flotorch Eval mix Ragas and DeepEval according to the priority routing described in the [flotorch-eval repo](https://github.com/FissionAI/flotorch-eval/tree/develop) (Ragas first, DeepEval as fallback).\n",
    "- `evaluation_engine=\"ragas\"` — keeps every metric inside the [**Ragas**](https://docs.ragas.io/en/stable/getstarted/) rubric for RAG evaluations (aspect critic, faithfulness, context precision, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we choose the Ragas-only mode to keep all scores aligned with the same retrieval-aware framework.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Requirements**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Flotorch account with configured LLM, embedding model, and Knowledge Base.  \n",
    "- `gt.json` containing question–answer pairs for evaluation.  \n",
    "- `prompt.json` containing the system and user prompt templates.  assistant.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "#### **Documentation References**\n",
    "- [**flotorch-eval GitHub repo**](https://github.com/FissionAI/flotorch-eval/tree/develop) — reference implementation with sample notebooks and evaluation pipelines.\n",
    "- [**Ragas Aspect Critic Documentation**](https://docs.ragas.io/en/stable/concepts/metrics/available_metrics/aspect_critic/) — detailed explanation of the metric.\n",

    "- **`evaluation_engine`** — Here, we set this to `\"ragas\"`, meaning the evaluator will use the **[Ragas framework](https://docs.ragas.io/en/stable/getstarted/)** for metric computation.  \n",
    "  Ragas is well-suited for RAG-style evaluations and handles metrics such as:\n",
    "  - **Faithfulness**\n",
    "  - **Answer Relevance**\n",
    "  - **Context Precision**\n",
    "  - **Aspect Critic (custom quality evaluation)**  \n",
    "\n",
    "  Other available options include:\n",
    "  - **`\"deepeval\"`** — uses the [DeepEval framework](https://deepeval.com/docs/getting-started) for model-as-a-judge evaluations and LLM-critic metrics.  \n",
    "  - **`\"auto\"`** — automatically selects the most suitable evaluation engine based on the metric type.  \n",

    "### Aspect Critic Metric\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition**: Aspect Critic is a highly flexible, customizable metric that evaluates generated responses against **user-defined quality aspects**. Unlike pre-defined metrics that measure fixed criteria, Aspect Critic allows you to specify exactly what qualities matter for your specific use case. It uses an LLM evaluator to judge whether responses meet your custom-defined standards.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How It Works (Ragas Framework)**:\n",
    "1. **Define Custom Aspects** — Specify aspect name and definition (e.g., \"accuracy\": \"Does the response provide correct information based on the context?\")\n",
    "2. **LLM Evaluation** — An evaluator LLM analyzes the generated answer against each defined aspect criterion\n",
    "3. **Binary Scoring** — Each aspect receives a score of **0** (fails criterion) or **1** (meets criterion)\n",
    "4. **Aggregate Results** — Calculate overall performance across all defined aspects\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scoring System**:\n",
    "- **Score = 1 (Pass)**: The response meets the defined aspect criterion\n",
    "- **Score = 0 (Fail)**: The response does not meet the defined aspect criterion\n",
    "\n",

    "### What We Accomplished\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provided a complete, step-by-step workflow for evaluating a RAG agent using Flotorch Eval with the Ragas **Aspect Critic** metric.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Workflow Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Configured Infrastructure**\n",
    "   - Set up `FlotorchLLM` for answer generation\n",
    "   - Connected to `FlotorchVectorStore` for context retrieval\n",
    "   - Initialized `LLMEvaluator` with the Ragas engine for aspect scoring\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Generated Responses**\n",
    "   - Loaded ground truth questions from `gt.json`\n",
    "   - Retrieved relevant context from the Knowledge Base for each question\n",
    "   - Generated answers using the inference LLM with retrieved context\n",
    "   - Captured metadata (cost, latency, tokens) from each LLM call\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Evaluated Aspect Critic**\n",
    "   - Scored each generated answer against the custom guardrail rubric (maliciousness & coherence)\n",
    "   - Verified that responses uphold the clarity and safety expectations captured in those aspects\n",
    "   - Collected evaluation metrics and gateway statistics for each question\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Visualized Results**\n",
    "   - Displayed per-question aspect scores in a formatted table for quick analysis\n",
    "   - Exported complete results as JSON for further processing\n",
    "   - Highlighted items that failed an aspect so they can be reviewed or re-written\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Aspect score = 1.0** means the generated answer satisfies that guardrail requirement\n",
    "- **Aspect score = 0.0** means the response violates the aspect (e.g., unsafe tone or incoherent structure)\n",
    "- The metric evaluates **Generated Answer ↔ Context + Rubric**, NOT **Generated Answer ↔ Ground Truth**\n",
    "- Aspect Critic keeps RAG systems aligned with bespoke safety, tone, and structure expectations—critical for assistants like this e-commerce agent"
