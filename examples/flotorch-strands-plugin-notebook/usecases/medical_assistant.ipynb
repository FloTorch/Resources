        "# 🏥 Building an Intelligent Medical Assistant with Flotorch Strands\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook demonstrates how to build a smart, memory-enabled medical assistant using the `FlotorchStrandsAgent`. Our goal is to create a **Medical Consultation Agent** that intelligently gathers patient information and provides healthcare guidance while remembering patient history across sessions.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Objective\n",
        "\n",
        "The agent leverages the `FlotorchStrandsAgent` client to connect to an agent pre-configured on the Flotorch platform. This remote agent is equipped with **Memory capabilities** to perform several key functions:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Collect Patient Information**: Gather essential details (Name, Age, Gender)\n",
        "* **Understand Medical Needs**: Listen to symptoms and health concerns\n",
        "* **Provide Recommendations**: Offer dietary advice, lifestyle suggestions, and treatment guidance\n",
        "* **Remember Patient History**: Store and retrieve patient data across sessions using Mem0\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Advantage: Agent + Memory Integration\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook's primary benefit is the **seamless integration of agent intelligence with persistent memory**. All patient interactions are stored automatically, enabling the agent to:\n",
        "- Recognize returning patients instantly\n",
        "- Recall previous consultations and recommendations\n",
        "- Provide personalized care based on medical history\n",
        "- Build long-term patient relationships\n",
        "\n",
        "The agent configuration and memory provider are managed entirely on the Flotorch platform UI, allowing you to update behavior and storage settings without ever changing this notebook's code."

(3) Ask with empathy \"What brings you here today?\" and listen to symptoms/concerns. (4) Show empathy (\"I'm sorry to hear that\") and dig deeper with follow-up questions about duration, severity, triggers. (5) Ask about current medications and VALIDATE if they're appropriate for the condition - correct patient if wrong medication, suggest proper alternatives. (6) Gather medical history and allergies. (7) Provide comprehensive recommendations: suggested medications with dosages, 3-4 detailed lines of dietary advice, 3-4 detailed lines of lifestyle modifications, 4 detailed Do's, 4 detailed Don'ts. (8) Show complete structured summary with all information. (9) Store data SILENTLY without asking patient permission or mentioning \"saving/storing\". For returning patients, show previous summary, ask \"Is this you?\", if confirmed continue consultation and update/restore data. Must never repeat questions, never invent data, always validate medications, and maintain empathetic conversational tone.\n",
