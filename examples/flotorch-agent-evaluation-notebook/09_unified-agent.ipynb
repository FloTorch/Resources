        "\n",
        "- For a typical case like `add_items([1, 2, 3])`, the function will return `6`, which is correct.\n",
        "- If `items` contains non-numeric values (e.g., strings or `None`), it will raise a `TypeError` when trying to add them.\n",

        "- Variable naming is acceptable, but the function could be shorter and clearer.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Performance\n",
        "\n",
        "- Time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of `items`, which is optimal for summing a list.\n",
        "- There is a minor overhead from indexing (`items[i]`) instead of iterating directly over the elements.\n",

        "2. **Single Evaluator**: ONE `AgentEvaluator` instance for all metrics\n",
        "3. **Unified Evaluation**: All 6 metrics evaluated at once in a single call\n",
        "4. **Unified Display**: ONE display function shows all metric results together\n",

        "3. **Trajectory Evaluation with Reference** (`trajectory_evaluation_with_reference`) - Comparison against reference trajectories\n",
        "4. **Tool Call Accuracy** (`toolcall_accuracy`) - Tool usage decision evaluation\n",
        "5. **Agent Goal Accuracy** (`agent_goal_accuracy`) - Goal accomplishment assessment\n",
