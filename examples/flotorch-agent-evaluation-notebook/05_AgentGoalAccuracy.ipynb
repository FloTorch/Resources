        "\n",
        "### Step 1: Access Flotorch Console\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Log in to Flotorch Console**:\n",
        "   - Navigate to your Flotorch Console (e.g., `https://dev-console.flotorch.cloud`)\n",
        "   - Ensure you have the necessary permissions to create agents\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Navigate to Agents Section**:\n",
        "   - Click on **\"Agents\"** in the left sidebar\n",

        "   - Click it to start creating a new agent\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Agent Configuration**:\n",
        "   - **Agent Name**: Choose a unique name for your agent (e.g., `travel-planner-agent`)\n",
        "     - **Important**: The name should only contain alphanumeric characters and dashes (a-z, A-Z, 0-9, -)\n",
        "     - **Note**: Copy this agent name - you'll need to use it in the `agent_name` variable later\n",

        "### 1. Setup and Instrumentation\n",
        "- Configure a `FlotorchADKAgent` for travel planning tasks.\n",
        "- Enable **OpenTelemetry Tracing** via the `tracer_config`.\n",
        "- This instrumentation allows detailed capture of the complete agent trajectory and goal accomplishment.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. Execution and Data Generation\n",
        "- Run a sample travel planning query through the agent using the **Runner**.\n",
        "- This automatically generates an **Agent Trajectory** in the form of OpenTelemetry traces.\n",
        "- The trace records the complete execution path, including:\n",
        "  - Goal understanding and interpretation\n",
        "  - Travel plan generation and recommendations\n",
        "  - Pricing and option selection\n",
        "  - Step-by-step agent operations\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. Evaluation\n",
        "- Use the `AgentEvaluator` client along with the specialized **AgentGoalAccuracy** metric from `flotorch-eval`.\n",
        "- The evaluator processes the trace data to compute goal accuracy statistics using the **agent_goal_accuracy** metric.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. Analysis\n",
        "- The notebook displays a thorough goal accuracy assessment, including:\n",
        "  - **Accuracy Score** (0.0 to 1.0)\n",
        "  - **Evaluation Details** explaining goal accomplishment including:\n",
        "    - User goal summary\n",
        "    - Agent perception summary\n",
        "    - Execution path analysis\n",
        "    - Final outcome evaluation\n",
        "    - Overall conclusion\n",
        "\n",
        "## Purpose and Benefits\n",
        "\n",
        "This evaluation provides **actionable quality metrics** that help developers:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Identify goal accomplishment issues in the Travel Planner Agent  \n",
        "- Optimize travel plan generation to better meet user requirements  \n",
        "- Track quality trends over time  \n",
        "- Ensure the Travel Planner Agent delivers **comprehensive and accurate travel plans** with real-time pricing and best options"
