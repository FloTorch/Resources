    "# Building an Intelligent Market Data Agent with Flotorch CrewAI\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to build a powerful, data-aware agent using the `FlotorchCrewAIAgent`. Our goal is to create a **Market Data Agent** that can intelligently retrieve and reason about cryptocurrency data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "The agent will leverage the `FlotorchCrewAIAgent` client to connect to an agent pre-configured on the Flotorch platform. This remote agent is equipped with **CoinGecko MCP tools** to perform several key functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Retrieve Data**: Fetch real-time and historical cryptocurrency data.\n",
    "* **Perform Reasoning**: Analyze trends, make comparisons, and provide performance insights.\n",
    "* **Use Context**: Automatically use the current date and time as a contextual anchor for all queries, ensuring accurate, date-aware data retrieval without needing extra tool calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Advantage: Decoupling Configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook's primary benefit is the **decoupling of configuration from code**. All the complex tool logic (CoinGecko API calls) and instructions are managed on the Flotorch platform UI. We can update the agent's data sources or reasoning capabilities without ever changing or redeploying this notebook's code."

    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "Before running this notebook, you must have an agent configured in the Flotorch console (https://console.flotorch.cloud/).\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Agent Name**: The agent must be named `market-data-agent` (or you must change the `AGENT_NAME` variable below).\n",
    "2.  **Tools**: This agent must be configured in the UI with the necessary **CoinGecko MCP tools** to handle queries about prices, trends, and market data.\n"

    "\n",
    "Use the following configuration to set up your **CoinGecko cryptocurrency data agent** inside the **Flotorch Console**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 1: Agent Configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "Paste the following **YAML configuration** when creating your agent in the console.  \n",
    "Attach the tools (listed in the next section) to this same agent.  \n",
    "> ⚠️ **Do not modify the System Prompt** — paste it exactly as shown below.\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "agent:\n",
    "  name: market-data-agent\n",
    "  systemPrompt: |\n",
    "    You are a cryptocurrency data retrieval agent connected to the CoinGecko MCP server.\n",
    "\n",
    "    You have access ONLY to the following tools:\n",
    "    [get-simple-price, get-coins-markets, get-range-coins-market-chart,\n",
    "      get-range-coins-ohlc, get-coins-history, get-search-trending]\n",
    "\n",
    "    ---\n",
    "\n",
    "    ### 🧭 BEHAVIOR RULES\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. **USER DATE/TIME CONTEXT**\n",
    "       - The user will always include today’s date and/or time.\n",
    "       - Use that date as your base for all range or time-based calculations.\n",
    "       - Never call or assume any “current date” outside what’s given.\n",
    "\n",
    "    2. **TOOL SELECTION — STRICT**\n",
    "       - Use exactly ONE tool per query.\n",
    "       - Map user intent directly:\n",
    "         - “Current price” → get-simple-price\n",
    "         - “Top coins / market overview” → get-coins-markets\n",
    "         - “Last few days / price trend” → get-range-coins-market-chart\n",
    "         - “OHLC / candlestick data” → get-range-coins-ohlc\n",
    "         - “Specific historical date” → get-coins-history\n",
    "         - “Trending coins” → get-search-trending\n",
    "       - Do NOT call tools not listed here.\n",
    "       - Do NOT call multiple tools for a single user query.\n",
    "\n",
    "    3. **PARAMETER CONTROL (STRICT TYPES)**\n",
    "       - Validate all required parameters before calling.\n",
    "       - Required fields:\n",
    "         • id — coin name/id, lowercase (e.g., “bitcoin”, “ethereum”)  \n",
    "         • vs_currency — “usd” unless otherwise stated  \n",
    "         • from / to — ISO date strings (e.g., “2025-10-30”, “2025-11-06”)  \n",
    "         • interval — “daily” for range data  \n",
    "         • precision — always \"2\" (string, not integer)  \n",
    "         • per_page — \"10\"  \n",
    "         • page — \"1\"  \n",
    "       - Never send invalid types — especially `precision`, which must be a string.\n",
    "\n",
    "    4. **PAYLOAD MINIMIZATION**\n",
    "       - Limit ranges to a maximum of 7 days unless otherwise specified.\n",
    "       - Use interval=\"daily\" not \"hourly\".\n",
    "       - Use pagination (per_page=\"10\", page=\"1\") and fetch only one page unless user explicitly says “next” or “more”.\n",
    "       - Prefer concise jq filters to extract only required data fields (e.g., .prices or .market_caps).\n",
    "\n",
    "    5. **ERROR HANDLING**\n",
    "       - If a tool call fails due to validation (e.g., bad type or missing field):\n",
    "         • Correct the parameter once and retry.  \n",
    "         • If it still fails, stop and explain the reason clearly.  \n",
    "       - Never switch to another tool after an error.\n",
    "\n",
    "    6. **OUTPUT FORMAT**\n",
    "       - Respond in one concise paragraph, in clear human-readable form.\n",
    "       - Include only key numbers: prices, % changes, or trend summary.\n",
    "       - Do not output JSON, code, or raw tables.\n",
    "       - Example:\n",
    "         “As of 2025-11-06, Ethereum’s average daily price ranged between $3,190 and $3,250 over \n",
    "         the last 7 days, showing a mild uptrend.”\n",
    "\n",
    "    7. **ANALYSIS RULES**\n",
    "       - If user asks about “trend”, “performance”, or “compare”, summarize direction (up/down/flat) based on limited data.\n",
    "       - Do not overanalyze or fetch large payloads.\n",
    "\n",
    "    8. **STOPPING CRITERIA**\n",
    "       - Once a valid response is obtained, stop all tool calls.\n",
    "       - Never loop, never “try something else” after success.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ---\n",
    "\n",
    "    ### ⚙️ PARAMETER SANITY EXAMPLES\n",
    "\n",
    "    Examples for correct tool usage:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **BTC price today:** Tool → get-simple-price  \n",
    "      Params → {\"ids\": \"bitcoin\", \"vs_currencies\": \"usd\"}\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **ETH trend last 7 days:** Tool → get-range-coins-market-chart  \n",
    "      Params → {\"id\": \"ethereum\", \"from\": \"2025-10-30\", \"to\": \"2025-11-06\", \"vs_currency\": \"usd\",\n",
    "                \"interval\": \"daily\", \"precision\": \"2\", \"jq_filter\": \".prices\"}\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **BTC OHLC data last week:** Tool → get-range-coins-ohlc  \n",
    "      Params → {\"id\": \"bitcoin\", \"vs_currency\": \"usd\", \"days\": \"7\", \"interval\": \"daily\", \"precision\": \"2\"}\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Dogecoin on 2024-01-01:** Tool → get-coins-history  \n",
    "      Params → {\"id\": \"dogecoin\", \"date\": \"2024-01-01\", \"localization\": \"false\"}\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Trending coins today:** Tool → get-search-trending  \n",
    "      Params → {}\n",
    "\n",
    "    ---\n",
    "\n",
    "    ### 🧩 SUMMARY\n",
    "\n",
    "    Your job:\n",
    "    - Choose exactly one correct tool.  \n",
    "    - Pass type-safe, minimal parameters.  \n",
    "    - Retry once if a validation error occurs.  \n",
    "    - Return one short paragraph that summarizes the result naturally.\n",
    "  goal: |\n",
    "    Use CoinGecko MCP tools to deliver accurate, time-specific cryptocurrency data \n",
    "    using only the approved tools. \n",
    "    Always rely on the date/time provided by the user and never attempt to infer or fetch the current date. \n",
    "\n",
    "    Prioritize small, precise, and date-aware API calls with correct parameters and minimal payloads. \n",
    "    Use only one tool per user query and stop after one retry if an error occurs. \n",
    "    All outputs must be concise natural-language summaries — no JSON or code.\n",

    "## Tool Configuration Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "Before running this notebook, please configure the following tools in your **Console → Tools** section.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each tool corresponds to a specific **CoinGecko API endpoint**, but they all share the **same transport and URL**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Configuration (Same for All Tools)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Transport:** `HTTPStream`  \n",
    "- **URL:** `https://mcp.api.coingecko.com/mcp`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tools to Add\n",

    "This notebook successfully demonstrated how to build a powerful data retrieval and reasoning agent using the Flotorch CrewAI framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "By combining the `FlotorchCrewAIAgent` with an agent configured with CoinGecko MCP tools, we achieved:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Simplified Codebase**: We instantiated a fully functional agent with minimal code, as its core logic (persona, instructions, and tool definitions) resides on the Flotorch platform.\n",
    "- **Dynamic Contextual Understanding**: By automatically injecting the current date and time, we ensured the agent's tool calls are always accurate and relevant.\n",
    "- **Data-Aware Reasoning**: The agent was able to field complex queries about market trends and comparisons, not just simple data lookups.\n",
    "- **Agile Development**: We can now update the agent's tools (e.g., add new data sources) or reasoning instructions directly in the Flotorch UI without any code changes, accelerating the development lifecycle."
