    "# Simplified Agent Creation with FlotorchCrewAIAgent\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates a streamlined approach to creating and deploying CrewAI agents using the `FlotorchCrewAIAgent` client. This high-level abstraction allows you to manage your agent's configuration (role, goal, tools, etc.) in the Flotorch UI and load it directly into your code with a single command.\n",

    "### Prerequesit\n",
    "Configure agent, API key in Flotroch console (https://console.flotorch.cloud/)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Viewing logs\n",
    "Logs can be viewed in logs tab in Flotroch console (https://console.flotorch.cloud/)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Advantage:\n",
    "- **Decoupled Configuration**: Agent logic (role, goal, backstory) is managed on the Flotorch platform, not hardcoded in the notebook. This makes updates and management much easier."

    "- **Simplified Development**  \n",
    "  Instead of defining the agent's role, goal, and backstory directly in the code, we instantiated the `FlotorchCrewAIAgent` client, which dynamically loaded the configuration from the Flotorch platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Centralized Management**  \n",
    "  Enabled updating and managing agent personas and tasks directly through the Flotorch UI, without requiring changes to the notebook or application code.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Production-Ready Pattern**  \n",
    "  Demonstrated a best-practice pattern for deploying AI agents in production environments where agility and ease of management are critical.\n"
