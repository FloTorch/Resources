    "# Integrating Flotorch Session Management with CrewAI\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to integrate Flotorch's session management with a CrewAI agent. By using `FlotorchCrewAISession` as the storage backend for CrewAI's `ShortTermMemory`, we can create a conversational agent that remembers the context of the current session.\n",

    "Configure model, API key in Flotroch console (https://console.flotorch.cloud/)\n",

    "### Viewing logs\n",
    "Logs can be viewed in logs tab in Flotroch console (https://console.flotorch.cloud/)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts:\n",
    "- **`FlotorchCrewAILLM`**: The language model powering the agent.\n",
    "- **`FlotorchCrewAISession`**: The session storage mechanism for persisting conversation history.\n",
    "- **`ShortTermMemory`**: CrewAI's memory system, configured to use the Flotorch session backend.\n",
    "- **`Agent`, `Task`, `Crew`**: The core components for building and orchestrating the AI workflow."
