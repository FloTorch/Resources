    "This notebook demonstrated how to equip a Google ADK agent with a persistent, long-term memory using `FlotorchMemoryService`. This allows the agent to build and retain knowledge across completely separate user sessions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Achievements:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Memory Integration**: We successfully configured the `Runner` with `FlotorchMemoryService` to handle long-term storage.\n",
    "- **Knowledge Persistence**: The agent was able to store information from one session and accurately recall it in a new, later session.\n",
    "- **Advanced Capabilities**: This dual-memory architecture (short-term session context + long-term knowledge base) is crucial for creating truly intelligent and personalized AI assistants that learn over time."
