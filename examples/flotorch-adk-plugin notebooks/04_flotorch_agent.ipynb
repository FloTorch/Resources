    "# Simplified Agent Creation with `FlotorchADKAgent`\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the streamlined approach to creating agents using the `FlotorchADKAgent` client. This powerful feature allows you to manage your agent's core configuration (its name, instructions, and persona) on the Flotorch platform UI and then load it directly into your application code.\n",

    "Configure agent, API key in Flotroch console (https://console.flotorch.cloud/)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Viewing logs\n",
    "Logs can be viewed in logs tab in Flotroch console (https://console.flotorch.cloud/)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Advantage:\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary benefit is the **decoupling of configuration from code**. You can update your agent's behavior, instructions, or model choice through a user-friendly interface without ever needing to change and redeploy your application code. This notebook focuses on this core capability in its simplest form."

    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrated the power and simplicity of using `FlotorchADKAgent` to drive AI applications. By centralizing the agent's configuration on the Flotorch platform, we created a more flexible, maintainable, and scalable system.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Achievements:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Simplified Codebase**: We successfully instantiated a fully functional agent with minimal code, as its core logic (persona, instructions) resides on the Flotorch platform.\n",
    "- **Decoupled Architecture**: This workflow effectively separates the agent's behavioral configuration from the application's operational code, allowing different teams to manage each component independently.\n",
    "- **Agile Development**: Agent behavior can be tweaked, tested, and updated through the Flotorch UI without requiring any code changes or service redeployments, accelerating the development lifecycle."
